        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup strong brewed espresso coffee, cooled</li>
            <li>24 ladyfinger biscuits (Savoiardi)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <LI>Pinch of salt</LI>
            <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Brew the espresso coffee and let it cool completely.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of sugar until pale and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract to the egg yolk mixture. Beat until smooth and well combined. If using, add the Marsala wine or rum and mix until incorporated.</li>
            <li>In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the mascarpone mixture until well combined. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Pour the cooled espresso into a shallow dish. Dip each ladyfinger biscuit into the espresso quickly, ensuring they are soaked but not soggy.</li>
            <li>Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a serving dish or a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture evenly over the layer of soaked ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers, followed by the remaining mascarpone mixture.</li>
            <li>Cover the tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
            <li>Before serving, dust the top of the tiramisu with unsweetened cocoa powder using a fine sieve.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy your homemade tiramisu!</li>
        </ol>
